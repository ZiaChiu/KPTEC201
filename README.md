## Introduction

#### What is and Why R?
R is designed for data analysis and statistical computing.
Widely used for conducting statistics and specialized data analysis tasks.

Some classmates who have studied python and java will want to try to find the code logic corresponding to python or java in R's documentation.
But when I tried to use R to deal with some accounting problems, I found that the programming process of R tended more to the process-oriented programming of C. 

Once the logic of the code starts to become complex, you need to use concepts such as classes and functions similar to Python to achieve code reuse (that is, object-oriented programming).
Most of the time, you don't need to use OOP. The purpose of the R language is to process data, not to develop a program that can be run.
